/**
 * Shared "run one natural-language instruction" pipeline.
 *
 * Both the SDK's `StepRunner` and the playground's per-line handler used to
 * implement this pipeline inline. That duplication was the cause of bugs
 * where one surface (e.g. playground) supported a behaviour that the other
 * (e.g. SDK) silently lacked — most recently, element-targeted swipes.
 *
 * Now both surfaces call `runOneInstruction()` and add only their own UI /
 * state-tracking on top. The pipeline itself lives in exactly one place.
 *
 * Pipeline (in order):
 *
 * 1. **Vision-first** (when `AGENT_MODE=vision` and vision-locate is available):
 *    Call `visionExecute(instruction)` — the LLM gets the screenshot AND the
 *    raw instruction in one call, so it can identify named elements (e.g.
 *    "the first slider") that the regex parser below would strip out.
 *    The `__needs_executeStep__` sentinel from vision-execute is unwrapped here,
 *    so callers never see it.
 *
 * 2. **Regex fallback** — `tryParseNaturalFlowLine()` matches common patterns
 *    without an LLM call (e.g. `"tap login"`, `"swipe right"`, `"wait 2 seconds"`).
 *
 * 3. **LLM fallback** — `resolveNaturalStep()` translates anything the regex
 *    can't handle into a structured FlowStep.
 *
 * 4. **Execute** — `executeStep()` runs the resolved step on device.
 *
 * Goal mode (`runAgent`) is intentionally NOT a caller — it has its own
 * autonomous reasoning loop that calls MCP tools directly.
