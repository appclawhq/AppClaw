/**
 * Demonstrates the three things tests usually need:
 *  - deviceLabel → worker-scoped: built ONCE per device, reused across its tests
 *  - loggedInApp → test-scoped:   taps login fresh for every test
 *  - apiUser     → test-scoped:   provisions data via an API and RETURNS it
 *                                  (the test reads it back by destructuring)
 *
 * A fixture hands its data to the test by passing it to `use(value)`; the test
 * then destructures that value by the fixture's name. Built-ins like `device`
 * are always available to both fixtures and tests.
